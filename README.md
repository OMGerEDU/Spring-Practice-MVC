# Spring-Practice-MVC
Spring Boot practices using MVC architecture for simple web service.

I've uploaded my practice. It's a basic example for anyone interested in exploring how Spring Boot can be used in a web service.

Feel free to use this code for your own projects. If you can suggest improvements or add more services, your contributions are welcome. You can simply submit a pull request.

In recognition of your contribution, I'll add your name to the list of contributors. Even small projects like this can grow through community collaboration, and I look forward to seeing how we can develop it together.
